            [Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
            You live in my dream state
            Relocate my fantasy
            I stay in reality
            You live in my dream state
            Any time I count sheep
            That's the only time we make up, make up
            You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
            Now, I don't wanna wake up
            
            [Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator with Kali Uchis]
            20/20, 20/20 vision
            Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I
            Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind
            I said, I said
            I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
            You're the one that's always running through my daydream, I
            I can only see your face when I close my eyes
            (Uh-huh)
            
            [Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
            Can I get a kiss?
            And can you make it last forever?
            I said I'm 'bout to go to war (Uh-huh)
            And I don't know if I'ma see you again
            Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
            And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
            I said I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)
            And I don't know if I'ma see you again
            Ugh, switch it up</p>
